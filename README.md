	- Prediction is at the heart of almost every scientific discipline, and the study of generalization (that is, prediction) from data is the central topic of machine learning and statistics, and more generally, data mining. Machine learning and statistical methods are used throughout the scientific world for their use in handling the "information overload" that characterizes our current digital age. Machine learning developed from the artificial intelligence community, mainly within the last 30 years, at the same time that statistics has made major advances due to the availability of modern computing. However, parts of these two fields aim at the same goal, that is, of prediction from data. This course provides a selection of the most important topics from both of these subjects.

Recently, deep learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks. These models can often be trained with a single end-to-end model and do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this spring quarter course students will learn to implement, train, debug, visualize and invent their own neural network models. The course provides a deep excursion into cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP.

- [10-708](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708-14/index.html) **Probabilistic Graphical Models** *Carnegie Mellon University*   :video_camera:    :green_book:    :computer:  
 - Many of the problems in artificial intelligence, statistics, computer systems, computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, among many other fields, can be viewed as the search for a coherent global conclusion from local information. The probabilistic graphical models framework provides a unified view for this wide range of problems, enabling efficient inference, decision-making and learning in problems with a very large number of attributes and huge datasets. This graduate-level course will provide you with a strong foundation for both applying graphical models to complex problems and for addressing core research topics in graphical models.

- [EE103](http://stanford.edu/class/ee103/) **Introduction to Matrix Methods** *Stanford University*   :computer:    :green_book:  
	- The course covers the basics of matrices and vectors, solving linear equations, least-squares methods, and many applications. It'll cover the mathematics, but the focus will be on using matrix methods in applications such as tomography, image processing, data fitting, time series prediction, finance, and many others. EE103 is based on a book that [Stephen Boyd](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/) and [Lieven Vandenberghe](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/) are currently writing. Students will use a new language called [Julia](http://julialang.org/) to do computations with matrices and vectors.
